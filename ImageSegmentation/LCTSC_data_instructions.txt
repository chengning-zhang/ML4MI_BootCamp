Navigate to:
https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/Lung+CT+Segmentation+Challenge+2017

Click the orange "search" button.
Browse through the pages and find the datasets that have "Train" in the name. Add as many to the cart as you like using the green + button.
There are 36 total training subjects but we only used 10 in the Bootcamp example.
Click the tab "Manage Data Basket".
The LCTSC data should be listed.
Make sure that the checkbox for "Include annotation files in the download?" is selected.
Click "Start Download" and save the file to a convenient location.
Open the file using the TCIA Downloader you installed.
Browse to a directory where you wish to store the data and click "Start".

The images will be downloaded to a directory named "LCTSC". This directory needs to be found by the segmentation code. The easiest way is to put in in the same location as the Python file.
